        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>I am Diptonil Mitra from Kolkata. I have 9 months of experience and have core skills in front end development like HTML
            CSS, JavaScript and React-JavaScript. My strength is that I always trust others and always want to help them on priority basis rather than completing my task first
            and my weakness is that I am not able to perform multiple tasking on one time go. In future long term, I will like to give my best for whichever company I will be hired for by upskilling myself and further to help my organisation to reach further milestone.
            </p>
